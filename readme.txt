WordPress plugin for `WooCommerce - Payment Gateway` using [QPay](https://qpay.mn/)

== Description ==

- We wanted to enable shops that are built on WordPress to pay easily
- However there were no readily available WordPress plugin for Mongolian banking gateways or QPay

- Thats why we decided to build one ourselves and make it free to use for everyone
